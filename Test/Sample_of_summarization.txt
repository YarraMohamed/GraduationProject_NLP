In this first lesson, the narrator explains how different types of animals and plants adapt to different climates and make certain adaptations in order to survive.
He uses examples such as a desert lizard that finds shade during a hot sunny day and discusses how lizards have colorful scales that make them hard to see among the rocks.
He also uses the example of the penguin to demonstrate how certain adaptations help an animal survive in a cold climate.
Next, he demonstrates how penguins feet keep warm in extremely cold temperatures by using blood vessels in their feet as an example of an adaptation.
The goal of this lesson is to learn about how various forms of adaptation are related to each other so that one part of an organism can be used to benefit another part of the body.
For example, if you could stand on an icy sheet of ice in bare feet, you would lose feeling in your feet after only two minutes; for penguins, however, they have no feathers on their feet and can stand on the ice all day without losing feeling in their toes.
This is very important because penguins cannot fly.
Later in the same lesson, we discuss how the big ears on a fox help it stay cool and how the path of blood vessel in a penguin helps its feet stay warm.
Each activity in this lesson focuses on trying to apply lessons from this lesson to real-world applications in real-life scenarios.
In this case, talking with a scientist might be the best way to find out about penguins' ability to survive in extreme climates.
Here, for example, we look at how Arctic polar bears use their thick white fur to blend in with the snow as they go hunting and also dark fur helps brown bears live in temperate environments and light fur helps desert animals like brown bears blend in to their natural landscape.
Finally, we turn our attention to pale lizards, which have colorful colored scales on their hideously colorful lizards.
What kind of camouflage do these lizards need to camouflage themselves? And why do bighorn sheep need to wear different colors of fur depending on the season? These activities end with a discussion of how different kinds of animals cope with different seasons and lengths of captivity.
Following this lesson, students should always try to understand how other people deal with difficult or extreme situations and come to the same conclusion: "Adaptation and Survival" is a general term for dealing with problems in the natural world.
It's not just about being able to talk about things you're not sure about; it can also refer to specific life skill areas.
An example of this type of learning is listening to a scientist who knows a lot of questions.
When scientists learn something new, they may start asking more questions until they get to the point of answering those questions.
A penguin, for instance, doesn't have any feathers on its feet, but it can stick around on an ice patch all day even though it lives in Antarctica, which is one of the coldest places on the Earth.
Why? Because there are blood vessels moving through its feet.
